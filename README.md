# Turbo-Ontology
Hosts the TURBO Ontology and supporting files

The Penn implementation currently downloads the turbo ontology from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PennTURBO/turbo-ontology/dev/ontologies/turbo_merged.owl

That version was constructed manually and imports OBO terms with OntoFox and OntoDog

A ROBOT-based version is currently under developent.
