The official OBI definition, explaining the meaning of a class or property: 'Shall be Aristotelian, formalized and normalized. Can be augmented with colloquial definitions'  is terrible.

Can you fix to something like:

A statement of necessary and sufficient conditions explaining the meaning of an expression referring to a class or property.

Alan Ruttenberg

Your proposed definition is a reasonable candidate, except that it is very common that necessary and sufficient conditions are not given. Mostly they are necessary, occasionally they are necessary and sufficient or just sufficient. Often they use terms that are not themselves defined and so they effectively can't be evaluated by those criteria. 

On the specifics of the proposed definition:

We don't have definitions of 'meaning' or 'expression' or 'property'. For 'reference' in the intended sense I think we use the term 'denotation'. For 'expression', I think we you mean symbol, or identifier. For 'meaning' it differs for class and property. For class we want documentation that let's the intended reader determine whether an entity is instance of the class, or not. For property we want documentation that let's the intended reader determine, given a pair of potential relata, whether the assertion that the relation holds is true. The 'intended reader' part suggests that we also specify who, we expect, would be able to understand the definition, and also generalizes over human and computer reader to include textual and logical definition. 

Personally, I am more comfortable weakening definition to documentation, with instructions as to what is desirable. 

We also have the outstanding issue of how to aim different definitions to different audiences. A clinical audience reading chebi wants a different sort of definition documentation/definition from a chemistry trained audience, and similarly there is a need for a definition that is adequate for an ontologist to work with.

A feature being 'of genomic origin' here means only that its sequence has been located to the genome of some organism by alignment with some reference genome. This is because the sequence was originally identified in, or artificially created to replicate, sequence from an organism's genome. 

2. The location of a genomic feature is defined by start and end coordinates based on alignment with a reference genome. Genomic features can span any size from a complete chromosome, to a chromosomal band or region, to a gene, to a single base pair or even junction between base pairs (this would be a sequence feature with an extent of zero). 

3. As sequence features, instances of genomic features are identified by both their inherent *sequence* and their *position* in a genome - as determined by an alignment with some reference sequence. Accordingly, the 'ATG' start codon in the coding DNA sequence of the human AKT gene and the 'ATG' start codon in the human SHH gene represent two distinct genomic features despite having he same sequence, in virtue of their different positions in the genome.""" ;

The notion of wild-type alleles is more common in model organism databases, where specific mutations are generated against a wild-type reference feature. Wild-type alleles are typically but not always used as reference alleles in sequence comparison/analysis applications. More than one wild-type sequence can exist for a given feature, but typically only one allele is deemed wild-type iin the context of a single dataset or analysis.""" ;
