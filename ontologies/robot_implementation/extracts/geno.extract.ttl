The fact that we are counting how many copies of the same *sequence* exist in a genome, as opposed to how many of the same *feature*, is what sets  feature-level concepts like 'single locus complement'. apart from sequence-level concepts like 'copy number complement'. To illustrate the difference, consider a duplication event that creates a new copy of the human APOE gene on a different chromosome. This creates an entirely new sequence feature at a distinct locus from that of the original APOE gene.  The 'copy number complement' for sequence defined by the APOE gene locus would have a count of three, as this sequence is present three times in the genome.  But the 'single locus complement' at the APOE gene locus would still have a count of two - because the duplicated copy is at a different location in the genome, and therefore does not represent a copy of the APOE locus.""" ;

For example, the 'ATG' sequence beginning the ORF of the human SHH gene shares the *same sequence* as the 'ATG' beginning the ORF of the human AKT gene. But these are *distinct sequence features* because they occupy different genomic locations.

Within the genome of a single diploid organism, there is potential for two alleles to exist at such a locus (i.e. two different versions of the SHH gene).  And across genomes of all members of a species, many more alleles of the SHH gene may exist and occupy this same locus.

3. 'Qualified sequence feature' identity is additionally dependent on some aspect of the physical state or context of the genetic material in which the feature is concretized. This third criteria is extrinsic to its sequence and its genomic location. For example, the feature's physical concretization being targeted by a gene knockdown reagent in a cell (e.g. the zebrafish Shha gene as targeted by the morpholino 'Shha-MO1'), or its being transiently expressed from a recombinant expression construct (e.g. the human SHH gene as expressed in a  mouse Shh knock-out cell line), or its having been epigenetically modified in a way that alters its expression level or pattern (e.g. the human SHH gene with a specific methylation pattern).""" ,

For example, consider a situation where the zebrafish shha gene (a sequence feature) is targeted in two experimental groups of fish by two different morpholinos, and phenotypes are assessed for each.  We want to be able to represent two 'variants' of the shha gene in this scenario as separate 'qualified sequence feature' instances so we can capture data about the phenotypes resulting from each - just as we would separately represent to different sequence variants (alleles) of the shha gene at the sequence feature level so that we can track their associated phenotypes." ;
